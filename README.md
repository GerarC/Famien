# Famien
Famien is a project to create an NES emulator just for self fun. This is based on [olcNES](https://github.com/OneLoneCoder/olcNES).

## Compile
### Linux
Well to compile in linux some libraries are necessary:
- **GLFW**
- **GLEW**
   
Installation of libraries:
- To install it in **Arch** you can use `sudo pacman -S glfw glew`.
   
- The used command in **Ubuntu** to install needed libraries is `sudo apt install libglfw3-dev libglew-dev libgl1-mesa-dev`.   

### Windows version
*TODO:* I must to search a way to compile this in windows easily.





#### Thanks
- [OneLoneCoder](https://github.com/OneLoneCoder): I bassically copy its implementation of 6502 CPU. I made this project in C because I wanted to do not copy all the stuff, but re implement things.
- [RXI](https://github.com/rxi): I needed a map implementation, he had the implementation.
