Famien is a project to create an NES emulator just for self fun. This is based on (olcNES)[https://github.com/OneLoneCoder/olcNES].




#### Thanks
- (OneLoneCoder)[https://github.com/OneLoneCoder]: I bassically copy its implementation of 6502 CPU. I made this project in C because I wanted to do not copy all the stuff and have to re implement things.
- (RXI)[https://github.com/rxi]: I needed a map implementation, he had the implementation.
